'''
an e-commerce site has a series of advertisements to display.
links to the ads are stores in a data structure and
 they are displayed or not is based on the value at bit position in a number.
the sequence of ads being displayed at this time can be represented as binary vlaue.where 1 means the ad is displayed and 0 means the ad is not diplayed.the ads should rotate.
so,when the  next page loads,ads that are displayed now are hidden and vice versa

input:50
output:13

explaination : 50 in binary 110010
negation of 110010 is 001101 =13
